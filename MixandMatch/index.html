    <h2>Dinosaurs Riding Roller Coasters</h2>

    <p>
        Dinosaurs were a group of reptiles that lived on Earth during the Mesozoic Era. 
        They came in all shapes and sizes, from tiny, bird-like creatures to huge, long-necked giants. 
        Dinosaurs went extinct because of big changes in the environment, like a massive asteroid impact and volcanic eruptions.
