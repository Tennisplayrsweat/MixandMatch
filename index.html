<h>Dinosaurs Riding Roller Coasters </h>
<p>Dinosaurs were a group of reptiles that lived on Earth during the Mesozoic Era. They came in all shapes and sizes, from tiny, bird-like creatures to huge, long-necked giants. Dinosaurs went extinct because of big changes in the environment, like a massive asteroid impact and volcanic eruptions.</p>
